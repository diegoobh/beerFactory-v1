# beerFactory-v1
Final project for Desarrollo de Aplcaciones Avanzadas (USAL). 

I used Core Data to manage the data and I also obtain some initial data from a JSON file which is 
in the project bundle. 

It also implements an image picker that lets the user select an image of choice for wether the logo of a manufacturer
or a beer.
